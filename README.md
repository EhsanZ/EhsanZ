### Hi there 👋

My name is Ehsan | إحسان.

In Arabic, Ehsan means kindness, giving, perfection, excellence. I inherited this name from my grandmother, the greatest, kindest and the most amazing person I ever have known who made her life up to her name and I hope that one day I'll do the same.

One of my favorite English translations for Ehsan is philanthropy, according to Wikipedia, philanthropy means:
The love of humanity. A conventional modern definition is "private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality of life".
It's a unisex name too, and that makes it more beautiful.
